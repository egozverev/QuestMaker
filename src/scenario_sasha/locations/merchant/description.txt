	Wagon has approached. You see a Sancho Panza on his donkey.
You ask him:
-Senoir, what are you doing here?
He answers:
-I`ve left my previous job and now I`m a travelling merchant. I trade the most treasurable things in the world. Sushkas. Do u love sushkas, little girl? If you have some money, I may sell sushka for you.
After thinking a bit he goes on:
- Today is a special day. I have a super - sushka in my inventory. It is called "BARANKA". It costs 10 simple sushkas. Do u want to buy it?
